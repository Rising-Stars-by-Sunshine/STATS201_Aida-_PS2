This section shows the data query process of the data. This notebook shows how the data was loaded into a Jupyter notebook: [data query](data_query.ipynb). As the query process was not as extensive, some visualizations using the Dash app were also performed. Look into the code for this visualizations on the same folder: [visualization 1](app1.py), [visualization 2](app2.py), [visualization 3](app3.py).
