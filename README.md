# Content on this Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this repository, I describe my research that focuses on the Correlation between Economic Factors and Energy Access and understanding the key factors that contribute to the classification of countries into high, medium, and low energy efficiency levels. As my research delves into the exploration of machine learning methods, it looks to answer the following questions:
- RQ1: How do economic factors such as GDP per capita correlate with energy access disparities across different regions?
- RQ2: What factors contribute to the classification of countries into high, medium, and low energy efficiency levels, and can these factors be used to predict a country's energy efficiency?

Thus, this repository documents the steps in this process. Namely, it includes various sections covering literature reviews, research ideas, sample data, description of the data, and code from data query and visualization process.

## Aida Camacho Ponce de León 👩‍💻🌎

Hi! I'm Aida, originally from 🇲🇽 Mexico. I am form the class of 2026 at Duke Kunshan University. My major is Computation & Design with a track in Social Policy. Academically speaking, I have a deep passion for 💻📚 computational and statistical applications to social science issues, particularly 🌱 environmental policy. I am greatly interested in the intersection between computational and statistical sciences and social science. 

Personally speaking, I find joy in learning new languages and 🌐 connecting with people from diverse parts of the world, embracing various cultures along the way 🌟.

Currently at DKU, I am on a journey to challenge myself academically, socially, and personally.
